          This is the version 0.2.0 of GradeMate. I have added the much
          requested feature,{" "}

          Using this feature, you can estimate the effect of each assignment on
          your overall grade in any class. You can also add new temporary
          assignments and assign grades to them to see the effect of future
          assessments that are not even assigned to you yet.
